BIDS Stats Models
=================

*A specification for neuroimaging statistical models.*

*BIDS Stats Models* (BSM) is a collaborative effort to develop a specification to describe how to fit statistical models to neuroimaging data. Its purpose is prescriptive (e.g. a recipe), rather than descriptive (e.g. summary of already fit models). At the core of BSM is a machine-readable JSON document that allows users to define a fully reproducible model across multiple stages of analysis. A BSM—in combination with a preprocessed BIDS dataset—is sufficient to execute statistical models, with minimal configuration and intervention required from the user.

The **goal** of BSM is to promote scientific best practice by making neuroimaging models *transparent and reproducible*, as well as encourging the development of *standardized and automated* statistical analysis pipelines.

To **learn more**, step through our [User Guide](intro.md), or browse the [Model Zoo](model-zoo.md) for real example models on public datasets.

For details on the **formal specification**, visit the BSM [reference](reference.rst).
